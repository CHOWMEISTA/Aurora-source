Aurora Shaders is a lightweight, modern shader loader for Forge 1.20.1 designed to bring beauty, customization, and performance to Minecraft.

Aurora Shaders provides an Iris-style experience on Forge, allowing you to load and manage external shaderpacks directly from the in-game menus. It integrates seamlessly with the Video Settings and Pause Menu, offering instant access to shader selection and activation.

Features:
• Shaderpack Loader – automatically detects and loads .zip shaderpacks from the .minecraft/shaderpacks folder.
• In-Game Shader Menu – browse, select, and apply shaders directly from within Minecraft.
• Lightweight Core – minimal overhead and zero dependencies.
• Hot Reloading – change shaderpacks without restarting the game.
• Open Architecture – easy for developers and shader creators to extend.

Compatibility:
• Works with Forge 47.x (Minecraft 1.20.1)
• Does not require or depend on Iris or Oculus
• Compatible with performance mods such as Rubidium or Embeddium (when Oculus is not present)

Vision:
Aurora Shaders aims to deliver a fast, stable, and open alternative to Oculus on Forge—providing beautiful visuals, simple integration, and complete freedom for creators.
